## Breakout for the RN52 module.

Essentially works the same as the Adafruit one, with a slightly different pinout. Firstly it was cheaper to do it this way w/ OSHPark as the printer and buying the module from Farnell & secondly it was the first board I made so a good way to practice using Eagle for something simple.
